This input given to your webhook has the same structure as the output produced when you call [Retrieve Messages](#tag/Message%2Fpaths%2F~1messages%2Fget).\\n- When you register or update your webhook, the URL will be tested by invoking it with an empty array (`[]`).\\n- It is possible for your webhook to receive multiple updates for the same message and status. It happens from time to time that the mobile network duplicates status updates.\\n- The order by which the webhook is invoked can be unexpected.  For example, if sender A replies before sender B, your webhook might get the reply from B first.\\n- The webhook is expected to comply with good practices with regard to the status code it responds with.\\n  - A status code in the `1xx` and `2xx` range is taken as an acknowledgement that the invocation was received and that the webhook host is ready to receive another.\\n  - A status code in the `4xx` range is taken as a permanent problem and indicates that the webhook cannot process the message. The specific message that caused the error will be discarded, but your webhook will be invoked again when another message becomes available.\\n  - Any other status code will be taken as a temporary problem; and indicates that the BulkSMS system should retry. The specific message that caused the error will not be discarded and your webhook will be invoked again with this message (see the subsequent section for more details on retry processing).\\n- Your webhook has to respond within `30` seconds.  If no response is given in this time, the invocation will be retried.\\n- It is good practise to add a secret to your URL in order to make it more secure. Here is an example:\\n`https://www.example.com/hook.php?secret=pass763265word`\\n- You can also use a non-standard port if necessary, for example: `https://www.example.com:8321/hook.php?secret=pass763265word`\\n\\n\\n### The retry process\\n\\nThe process the BulkSMS systems follow to handle retries is roughly the following:\\n- The first retry is scheduled for 90 seconds into the future.\\n- After the first retry, subsequent failures will have longer delays, following this sequence - 3 minutes, 6 minutes, 12 minutes, 24 minutes, 48 minutes, 96 minutes, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours.\\n- When a failure occurs after the last delay in the sequence, the message is discarded.\\n\\n### Problem reports via email\\n\\nIt is strongly suggested that you provide an email address when you configure your webhook.\\nAn email will be sent to this address to keep you in the loop whenever there are problems with your webhook.\\nIn order to prevent your mailbox from being flooded, the BulksSMS system reports an observed error code no more than once in a 24 hour period.\\n\\nThe following emails can be expected\\n - A __message retrying__ email is sent after an invocation has failed with a retry-able error.  This email is an early warning, allowing you to investigate your systems.\\n - A __message discarded__ email is sent after failure email is send when a message is discarded as a consequence of a non-retry-able error; or when the system decides to stop retrying.\\n']\n",

The stream consists of a series of frames, each containing a header and a payload.\\n\\nThe header contains the information which the stream writes (`stdout` or `stderr`). It also contains the size of the associated frame encoded in the last four bytes (`uint32`).\\n\\nIt is encoded on the first eight bytes like this:\\n\\n```go\\nheader := [8]byte{STREAM_TYPE, 0, 0, 0, SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4}\\n```\\n\\n`STREAM_TYPE` can be:\\n\\n- 0: `stdin` (is written on `stdout`)\\n- 1: `stdout`\\n- 2: `stderr`\\n\\n`SIZE1, SIZE2, SIZE3, SIZE4` are the four bytes of the `uint32` size encoded as big endian.\\n\\nFollowing the header is the payload, which is the specified number of bytes of `STREAM_TYPE`.\\n\\nThe simplest way to implement this protocol is the following:\\n\\n1. Read 8 bytes.\\n2. Choose `stdout` or `stderr` depending on the first byte.\\n3. Extract the frame size from the last four bytes.\\n4. Read the extracted size and output it on the correct output.\\n5. Goto 1.\\n\\n### Stream format when using a TTY\\n\\nWhen the TTY setting is enabled in [`POST /containers/create`](#operation/ContainerCreate), the stream is not multiplexed. The data exchanged over the hijacked connection is simply the raw data from the process PTY and client's `stdin`.\\n\"]\n",

Use the parameters `assertionId`, `authenticationInstant`, `authenticationMethod`, `clientUserId`, and `securityDomain` to record information on how the recipient was authenticated. At a minimum, `authenticationMethod` and `clientUserId` are required. The information that you provide is included in the envelope's certificate of completion.\\n\\n## The event status parameter\\nAfter the signer completes or ends the signing ceremony, DocuSign will redirect the user's browser back to your app via the `returnUrl` that you supply. DocuSIgn appends an `event` query parameter to the URL with the outcome of the signing ceremony. Your app should use the event parameter to determine the next step for the envelope. Don't fetch the envelope's status via Envelopes: get or a similar method; that could break the DocuSign rule against polling.\\n\\n## The URL is time-limited\\nThe URL returned by this method is valid for one use. It must be used/displayed within a couple of minutes after being generated. Once the recipient is redirected to the recipient view, they must interact with the DocuSign system periodically or their session will time out.\\n\\nBecause the URL is time-limited, it should not be stored or sent via email. Immediately redirect the user's browser to the URL after you receive it.\\n\\nIf you want to invite someone to an embedded signing session via email, the email invitation's URL must be to your application. When invoked, your app should request a recipientView URL from DocuSign and then redirect the signer to that URL.\\n\\n## Maintaining State\\nAfter the recipient completes the recipient view (or signing ceremony), they are redirected to your application. Your application can recover state information about the transaction by storing information in a cookie, or by including query parameters in the `returnUrl` field. Eg, `https://myapp.eg.com/docusign_return?myState=12345` When the user is redirected to your app, the `event` query parameter will be appended.

The path parameter is also required and should be the OSF path attribute of the folder being written to. The rename and conflict parameters are optional. If you wish to change the name of the file or folder at its destination, set the rename parameter to the new name. The conflict param governs how name clashes are resolved. Possible values are replace and keep. replace is the default and will overwrite the file that already exists in the target folder. keep will attempt to keep both by adding a suffix to the new file\\'s name until it no longer conflicts. The suffix will be \\' (x)\\' where x is a increasing integer starting from 1. This behavior is intended to mimic that of the OS X Finder. The response will contain either a folder entity or file entity with the new name.\\nFiles and folders can also be moved between nodes and providers. The resource parameter is the id of the node under which the file/folder should be moved. It must agree with the path parameter, that is the path must identify a valid folder under the node identified by resource. Likewise, the provider parameter may be used to move the file/folder to another storage provider, but both the resource and path parameters must belong to a node and folder already extant on that provider. Both resource and provider default to the current node and providers.\\nIf a moved/copied file is overwriting an existing file, a 200 OK response will be returned. Otherwise, a 201 Created will be returned.']\n",

If you do not specify a value for the name, Zuora will create one automatically. The automatically generated value is known as the subscription number, such as `A-S00000080`. You cannot change the subscription name or number after creating the subscription. \\n\\n* **Subscription name**: The name that you set for the subscription.\\n* **Subscription number**: The value generated by Zuora automatically if you do not specify a subscription name. \\n\\nBoth the subscription name and number must be unique. If they are not, an error will occur.\\n\\n### Subscription ID \\nThe subscription ID is a 32-digit ID in the format 4028xxxx. This is also the unique identifier for a subscription. This value is automatically generated by the system and cannot be edited or updated, but it can be queried. One subscription can have only one subscription name or number, but it can have multiple IDs: Each version of a subscription has a different ID.\\n\\nThe Subscription object contains the fields `OriginalId` and `PreviousSubscriptionId`. `OriginalId` is the ID for the first version of a subscription. `PreviousSubscriptionId` is the ID of the version created immediately prior to the current version.\\n\\n## Subscription Preview \\nYou can preview invoices that would be generated by the subscribe call. \\n\\n## Invoice Subscriptions Separately\\nIf you have enabled the invoice subscriptions separately feature, a subscribe call will generate an invoice for each subscription for every subscription where the field `IsInvoiceSeparate` is set to `true`.\\n\\nIf the invoice subscriptions separately feature is disabled, a subscribe call will generate a single invoice for all subscriptions.\\n\\nSee [Invoicing Subscriptions Separately](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/BC_Subscription_Management/Subscriptions/B_Creating_Subscriptions/Invoicing_Subscriptions_Separately) for more information.\\n\\n## Subscriptions and Draft Invoices \\nIf a draft invoice that includes charges exists in a customer account, using the subscribe call to create a new subscription and generate an invoice will cause the new subscription to be added to the existing draft invoice. Zuora will then post the invoice. \\n\\n## When to Use Subscribe and Create Calls \\nYou can use either the subscribe call or the create call to create the objects associated with a subscription (accounts, contacts, and so on). There are differences between these calls, however, and some situations are better for one or the other.\\n\\n### Use the Subscribe Call \\nThe subscribe call bundles up all the information you need for a subscription. Use the subscribe call to create new subscriptions when you have all the information you need.\\n\\nSubscribe calls cannot update BillTo, SoldTo, and Account objects. Payment information objects cannot be updated if there is an existing account ID in the call. These objects are not supported in a subscribe call.\\n\\n### Use the Create Call \\nThe create call is more useful when you want to develop in stages. For example, if you want to first create an account, then a contact, and so on. If you do not have all information available, use the create call. To create a subscription, you must activate the account from Draft status to Active by calling the subscribe call.\\n']\n",

There are no path or query parameters. The data is uploaded using the HTTP multipart/form-data POST method and applied to the user's tenant. \\n\\n## How this REST API Call Works\\nThe content of the uploaded usage file must follow the format used by the UI import tool. It must be a comma-separated (CSV) file with a corresponding .csv extension. The length of the file name must not exceed 50 characters. The file size must not exceed 4MB. See [Downloading the Usage Template](https://knowledgecenter.zuora.com/CB_Billing/J_Billing_Operations/Usage/C_Import_Usage_Data#Downloading_the_Usage_Template) to learn about how to download the usage file template.\\n\\nAt the completion of the upload, before the file contents are actually being processed, the API returns a response containing the byte count of the received file and a URL for checking the status of the import process.  Of the five possible results displayed at that URL (Pending, Processing, Completed, Canceled, and Failed) only a Completed status indicates that the import was successful.  The operation is atomic; if any record fails, the file is rejected. In that case, the entire import is rolled back and all stored data is returned to its original state.\\n\\nTo view the actual import status, enter the resulting status URL from the checkImportStatus response using a tool such as POSTMAN. This additional step provides more information about why the import has failed.\\n\\nTo manage the information after a successful upload, use the web-based UI.\\n\\n## Usage File Format\\nThe usage file uses the following headings: \\n\\n| Heading         | Description   | Required |\\n|-----------------|--------|----------|\\n| ACCOUNT_ID      | Enter the account number, e.g., the default account number, such as A00000001, or your custom account number. Although this field is labeled as Account_Id, it is not the actual Account ID nor Account Name.  | Yes      |\\n| UOM             | Enter the unit of measure. This must match the UOM for the usage. | Yes      |\\n| QTY             | Enter the quantity.  | Yes      |\\n| STARTDATE       | Enter the start date of the usage. This date determines the invoice item service period the associated usage is billed to. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM/DD/YYYY`. | Yes |\\n| ENDDATE         | Enter the end date of the usage. This is not used in calculations for usage billing and is optional. Date format is based on locale of the current user. Default date format: `MM/DD/YYYY`. <p>**Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required.</p> | No |\\n| SUBSCRIPTION_ID | Enter the subscription number or subscription name. If you created the subscription in the Zuora application, Zuora created a number automatically in a format similar to A-S00000001. If you do not provide a value for this field, the associated usage will be added to all subscriptions for the specified Account that use this Unit Of Measure. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record.  <p>**Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required.</p>  | No   |\\n| CHARGE_ID       | Enter the charge number (not the charge name). You can see the charge ID, e.g., C-00000001, when you add your rate plan to your subscription and view your individual charges. If your Accounts can have multiple subscriptions and you do not want double or triple counting of usage, you must specify the specific Subscription or Charge ID in each usage record. This field is related to the Charge Number on the subscription rate plan.  <p>**Note:** The value of this column is optional, but the column header is required.</p>  | No      |\\n| DESCRIPTION     | Enter a description for the charge. | No       |\\n\"]\n",
